## Integration Steps

### Add SDK

Please add WatchParty SDK as a dependency via Swift Package Manager. Use below git url.

https://github.com/JioMeet/JioMeetCoreSDK_iOS

### Import SDK

Please use below import statements

```swift
import JioMeetCoreSDK
import JioMeetWatchParty
```

## Create WatchParty View Model

First create an instance of JVWatchPartyViewModel . Make sure it should not go out of scope once UI is rerendered on state change. You can use a Singleton class and create a variable of JVWatchPartyViewModel type.
You need to assign some initial values by JVWatchPartyViewModel instance like user type (guest or logged in user), meeting ID, meeting pin and party owner name.

### Set User Type
Use setUserType method of JVWatchPartyViewModel .

### Set Meeting Data
Use setMeetingData method of JVWatchPartyViewModel .

Please take below reference.

```swift
class PartyManager: NSObject {

   static let instance = PartyManager()
   let viewModel = JVWatchPartyViewModel()

   override init() { 
      super.init()
      let isUserLoggedIn = UserDefaults.standard.value(forKey: "isUserLoggedIN") as? Bool ?? false
      if isUserLoggedIn {
         viewModel.setUserType(type: .loggedIn(userName: "John"))
      } else {
         viewModel.setUserType(type: .guest)
      }
   }

   func setMeetingData(meetingID: String, meetingPIN: String, ownerName: String) {
      viewModel.setMeetingData(
            meetingID: meetingID,
            meetingPIN: meetingPIN,
            ownerName: ownerName
      )
   }

}
```


### Create Meeting Configuration

Create a `JMJoinMeetingConfig` type object. Following are the properties of this object.

| Property Name | Type  | Description  |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| userRole | JMUserRole | Role of the user in the meeting. Possible values are `.host`, `.speaker`, `.audience`. If you are assigning `.host` value, please pass the token in its argument. |
| isInitialAudioOn | Bool | Initial Audio State of the user when user joins the meeting. If meeting is hard muted by a host, initial audio state will be muted and this setting will not take place. |
| isInitialVideoOn | Bool | Initial Video State of the user when user joins the meeting. |

```swift
let joinMeetingConfig = JMJoinMeetingConfig(
    userRole: .host(hostToken: "MD5hQxGAwjW2"),
    isInitialAudioOn: false,
    isInitialVideoOn: false
)
```

### Join Meeting with data and config

After creating `JMJoinMeetingData` and `JMJoinMeetingConfig` objects, call `joinMeeting` method of `JMClient` instance.

Following are the arguments of `joinMeeting` method.

| Argument Name | Type  | Description  |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| meetingData | JMJoinMeetingData | Meeting Data which include meeting id, pin and user display name. |
| config | JMJoinMeetingConfig | Meeting Configuration which include user role, mic and camera initial states. |
| delegate | JMClientDelegate? | A class conforming to `JMClientDelegate` protocol.  |


```swift
meetingView.joinMeeting(
    meetingData: joinMeetingData,
    config: joinMeetingConfig,
    delegate: self
)
```

**Note: Host Token can be nil.**

### Implement JMMeetingViewDelegate methods

Confirm your class with `JMMeetingViewDelegate` protocol and implement its methods

```swift

// Local User has left the meeting
func didLocalUserExitsMeetingView() {
    navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
}

// Local User failed to joined the meeting. Please use errorMessage to show any error.
func didLocalUserFailedToJoinMeeting(errorMessage: String) {
    showMeetingJoinError(message: errorMessage)
}

// UI SDK has requested to share meeting. Use meetingID and meetingPin to show any UI you want. For e.g. `UIActivityViewController`
func didRequestToShareMeetingView(meetingID: String, meetingPin: String) {
    showMeetingShareView(meetingID: meetingID, meetingPin: meetingPin)
}

// UI SDK has requested to create meeting share Link.
func didRequestToBuildMeetingShareLink(meetingID: String, meetingPin: String, completion: @escaping ((String) -> Void)) {
    var components = URLComponents()
    components.scheme = "https"
    components.host = "jiomeetpro.jio.com"
    components.path = "/shortener"
    components.queryItems = [
        URLQueryItem(name: "meetingId", value: meetingID),
        URLQueryItem(name: "pwd", value: meetingPin)
    ]
    
    guard let urlString = components.string else { return }
    completion(urlString)
}
```
